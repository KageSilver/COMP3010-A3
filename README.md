# COMP 3010 Assignment 3 - Tara Boulanger (7922331)

## Compilation details:
Nothing requires compilation.

## Running details
You can run the peer by typing: `python3 peer.py ip port` where ip is the ip you're connecting from and where port is the port number that you're using for that ip. I use 8680-8684.

### Other notes:
#### Peer cleaning:
I clean the peers in my TimeoutsQueue class.

#### Choosing longest chain:
I choose the longest chain in the findLongest() python in the Protocols class.
